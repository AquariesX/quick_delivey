# Firebase Service Account Setup

## Email Verification System Setup

The email verification system has been fixed and requires a Firebase service account key to work properly.

### Setup Instructions

1. **Create Firebase Service Account Key**:
   - Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
   - Select your project: `quick-delivery-fe107`
   - Go to Project Settings → Service Accounts
   - Click "Generate new private key"
   - Download the JSON file

2. **Add Service Account Key to Project**:
   - Rename the downloaded file to `firebase-service-account.json`
   - Place it in the root directory of your project
   - The file should contain your Firebase service account credentials

3. **Environment Variables**:
   Make sure your `.env` file contains:
   ```
   FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=quick-delivery-fe107
   NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=AIzaSyA6Zwg3QRf2qmsv56WHdqI5MbnX6owH1ZY
   NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=quick-delivery-fe107.firebaseapp.com
   NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=quick-delivery-fe107.firebasestorage.app
   NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=582139435085
   NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=1:582139435085:web:5da529a1a4d7fc6e326404
   ```

### What Was Fixed

- ✅ Firebase Admin SDK configuration
- ✅ Email verification API endpoint
- ✅ Error handling and logging
- ✅ Service account key loading
- ✅ Environment variable configuration

### Security Note

The `firebase-service-account.json` file is excluded from git commits for security reasons. Each developer/deployment environment needs to add their own service account key.

### Testing

After setup, test the verification flow:
1. Register a new user account
2. Check email for verification link
3. Click the verification link
4. Should see success message and redirect to login
